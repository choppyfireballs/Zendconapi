## 0.3.0 - 2017-08-07

### Added

- [#4](https://github.com/weierophinney/hal/pull/4) adds the ability to force
  both links and embedded resources to be rendered as collections, even if the
  given relation only contains one item.

  To force a link to be rendered as a collection, pass the attribute
  `__FORCE__COLLECTION__` with a boolean value of `true` (or use the constant
  `Link::AS_COLLECTION` to refer to the attribute name).

  To force an embedded resource to be rendered as a collection, pass a boolean
  `true` as the third argument to `embed()`. Alternately, pass an array
  containing the single resource to any of the constructor, `withElement()`, or
  `embed()`.

## 0.2.0 - 2017-07-13

### Added

- [#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/pull/1) adds a `Hal\Renderer`
  subcomponent with the following:
  - `Renderer` interface
  - `JsonRenderer`, for creating JSON representations of `HalResource` instances.
  - `XmlRenderer`, for creating XML representations of `HalResource` instances.

### Changed

- [#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/pull/1) changes `Hal\HalResponseFactory`
  to compose a `JsonRenderer` and `XmlRenderer`, instead of composing
  `$jsonFlags` and creating representations itself. 

  It also makes the response prototype and the stream factory the first
  arguments, as those will be the values most often injected.
  
  The constructor signature is
  now:

  ```php
  public function __construct(
      Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $responsePrototype = null,
      callable $streamFactory = null,
      Hal\Renderer\JsonRenderer $jsonRenderer = null,
      Hal\Renderer\XmlRenderer $xmlRenderer = null
  ) {
  ```

- [#1](https://github.com/weierophinney/pull/1) changes `Hal\HalResponseFactoryFactory`
  to comply with the new constructor signature of `Hal\HalResponseFactory`. It
  also updates to check for `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` and
  `Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface` services before attempting to use
  zend-diactoros classes.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

## 0.1.4 - 2017-07-12

  exactly like `fromRoute()`, but the generated `Link` instance will have the
  `isTemplated` property toggled `true`.

### Deprecated

### Fixed

## 0.1.3 - 2017-07-11

### Added

### Deprecated

## 0.1.2 - 2017-07-11

### Added

  `HalResponseFactory` instance.

### Deprecated

## 0.1.1 - 2017-07-11

### Added

- Adds the ability to inject route params and query string arguments at run-time
  to the route-based metadata instances.

  When dealing with route-based metadata, we may be dealing with
  sub-resources; in such cases, the route parameters may be derived from
  the request, and we will want to inject them at run-time.

  When dealing with collections, the query string arguments may indicate
  things such as searches, sort directions, sort columns, filters, limits,
  etc.; these will be derived from the request, and need to be injected at
  run-time.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

## 0.1.0 - 2017-07-10
